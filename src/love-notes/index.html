                <p>We'll help you go all out for your boo, make your friend's day, surprise your favorite professor, or get your crush to notice you—all while supporting the Downtown Women's Center! (Seriously, our rizz is unmatched.)</p>

                    <li>Pick a song that you would like Medleys to sing. We have 12 fun options this year: "Everytime We Touch," "L-O-V-E," "Kiss the Girl," "Can't Take My Eyes Off You," "I Want to Hold Your Hand," "Never Gonna Give You Up," "Perfect," "Stand By Me," "To Make You Feel My Love," "Just the Way You Are," "You Belong With Me," and "I Want It That Way"!</li>
                    <li>Let us know your preferred time for delivery. We'll be available to sing at various times throughout the week leading up to Valentine's Day!</li>
                    <li>Choose a location! Available performance locations are limited to the UCLA campus and the immediate surrounding area (dorms, apartments, frat/sorority houses, etc.). This could mean a street corner in front of their apartment, the front of their lecture hall, their dorm hallway as they're heading back from a shower—the possibilities are endless!</li>
                    <li>Send us a payment in cash or through Venmo—we won't be able to perform until the payment has been received. All proceeds will be donated to the Downtown Women's Center.</li>
                    <li>We will meet you at the specified time and location so that you can take us to the Love Note recipient. Happy Valentine's Day!</li>
