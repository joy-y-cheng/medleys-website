                <p class="lead" style="color: black;">Are you looking for a fun, musical way to surprise a loved one this Valentine's Day? Well, look no further! Every year during the week of Valentine's Day, you can hire Medleys to serenade anyone you want. We'll help you go all out for your boo, make your friend's day, surprise your favorite professor, or get your crush to notice you—all while supporting the Downtown Women's Center! (Seriously, our rizz is unmatched.)</p>

                    <li>Pick a song that you would like Medleys to sing. We have 12 fun options this year!</li>
                    <li>Let us know your preferred time for delivery.</li>
                    <li>Choose a location! Available performance locations are limited to the UCLA campus and the immediate surrounding area (dorms, apartments, frat/sorority houses, etc.). This could mean a street corner in front of their apartment, the front of their lecture hall, their dorm hallway as they're heading back from a shower—the possibilities are endless!</li>
                    <li>Send us a payment in cash or through Venmo—we won't be able to perform until the payment has been received. All proceeds will be donated to the Downtown Women's Center.</li>
                    <li>We will meet you at the specified time and location so that you can take us to the Love Notes recipient!</li>
