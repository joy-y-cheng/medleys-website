                    <li>Pick a song that you would like Medleys to sing. We have over 10 fun options this year, including "Can't Take My Eyes Off You," "Never Gonna Give You Up," "Stand By Me," and "You Belong With Me"!</li>
                    <li>Let us know your preferred time for delivery. We'll be available to sing at various times throughout the week leading up to Valentine's Day!</li>
                    <li>Choose a location! Available performance locations are limited to the UCLA campus and the immediate surrounding area (dorms, apartments, frat/sorority houses, etc.). This could mean a street corner in front of their apartment, the front of their lecture hall, their dorm hallway as they're heading back from a shower—the possibilities are endless!</li>
                    <li>Send us a payment in cash or through Venmo—we won't be able to perform until the payment has been received. All proceeds will be donated to the Downtown Women's Center.</li>
                    <li>We will meet you at the specified time and location so that you can take us to the Love Note recipient. Happy Valentine's Day!</li>
