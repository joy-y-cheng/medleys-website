    {
        "question": "Where do I go for the audition?",
        "answer": "Auditions this year will be held in the Student Activities Center (SAC) on September 27th and in the John Wooden Center (JWC) on September 28th and 29th. The lobby of SAC is located on the third floor, and the lobby of JWC is located just outside the turnstiles when you enter through the front doors. Make sure to bring your BruinCard so you can swipe in for JWC. Once you're there, we will have you fill out a form and then walk you over to the audition room!"
    },
    {
        "question": "What if I don't know exactly when I can come in for an audition?",
        "answer": "We always accept walk-in auditions. Just come by the place where auditions are held sometime during auditions and we will do our best to fit you in! Keep in mind that we do have to give priority to people that have signed up for a spot, so you might have to wait for a bit."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is an audition usually like and how long will it take?",
        "answer": "During your initial audition, we'll ask you to sing various scales and vocal exercises (to check your vocal range) as well as around one minute or 32 bars of a prepared solo piece of your choice. You will also have a choice between completing a tonal memory exercise and a sight-reading exercise. In total, you should plan for the audition to take about 10 minutes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should I sing?",
        "answer": "Anything you'd like! We love all types of music and welcome pieces of all genres and languages. The bottom line is that we want you to sing something that you are comfortable with and that you feel showcases your talent best. The one rule that we have is that your selection MUST be without accompaniment (sorry, no instruments or backing tracks of any kind). There will be a keyboard available to supply your starting pitch. Since we will only listen to about one minute of your solo audition piece, we recommend that you choose an excerpt that immediately shows your vocal strength without any long introductions or instrumental breaks."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do I need to have lots of experience or be able to read music?",
        "answer": "Definitely not! Medleys makes selections based on those we feel have the greatest potential to contribute to the group. In years past we have taken students with years of musical and vocal training as well as students who have never sung in a group or played an instrument before in their lives. If we feel that a candidate has the potential to be a benefit to the group, we will consider taking them regardless of their experience or training."
    },
    {
        "question": "How big is Medleys and how many people are you going to take?",
        "answer": "Since we want to keep our group at a manageable size for travel, each year we usually have 12-16 members. The number of positions we are looking to fill fluctuates each year with our graduates, but we are usually looking for at least one person for each vocal part. That being said, we do not have a particular quota of spots to fill, and if we find someone who we feel is a good match for our group, we will accept them regardless of the number of \"available spaces.\""
    },
    {
        "question": "When will I find out about callbacks?",
        "answer": "We will contact you regarding callbacks via email once the last day of open auditions has finished."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are callbacks like and how long will they take?",
        "answer": "Callbacks are aimed at giving potential members a taste of what it is like to be in our a cappella group. The potential members who are called back will be emailed excerpts of sheet music which they will be responsible for learning before coming to callbacks. During callbacks, they will be asked to learn group warm-ups and will be given the chance to interact and sing with current group members (as well as other potential members) in small groups. In total, you should plan for callbacks to take 2-3 hours."
    },
    {
        "question": "When will I find out if I'm in Medleys?",
        "answer": "We will let everyone know the results of callbacks as soon as possible, but definitely before the decision day set by all a cappella groups."
    },
    {
        "question": "If I join Medleys, how much of a time commitment is it?",
        "answer": "Medleys rehearses 4 hours per week, which is fairly standard for most a cappella groups at UCLA. This quarter, our rehearsals are on Sundays from 5-7 PM and Wednesdays from 8-10 PM. We also perform several times a quarter at various locations in the LA area. Performances are usually on weekends and take 2-3 hours (including transportation). In addition, there are many social activities throughout the yearâ€”we love spending time together!"
