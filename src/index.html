                <h1>Who We Are</h1>
                <p class="lead">Medleys A Cappella is a community service-based group that combines a love for music and a desire to help the community.</p>
                <p>Originally an organization of UCLA Medical School students, the undergraduate version was founded by Virginia Liu in 2003 and has become increasingly active since its conception. In our twentieth year, we are dedicated to bringing the joy and healing of music to locations all around Los Angeles, hoping to make a difference—even if that means brightening a single person's day. Some of our favorite places to perform have been St. John’s Hospital of Santa Monica, the Downtown Women’s Center, UCLA Dance Marathon, and the UCLA Farmers Market. Medleys loves to bring a little happiness wherever we go, and we hope we make you smile!</p>
